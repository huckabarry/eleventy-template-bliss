Watched White Noise on Netflix last night. Sort of a strange one, but I ended up googling one of the songs being played by a couple in the movie, Dean Wareham & Britta Phillips - The Cloud is Coming - [music.apple.com/us/album/...](https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-cloud-is-coming/1658424556?i=1658424577)
