<p>New Outlook out of office reply:<br />Sorry I missed your message. My wife is on another Every Plate kick and currently we’re on week 3 of overly involved home cooked meals. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays I’m now taking PTO starting at 3 so I can leave work early enough to make sure dinner is ready before bedtime. Thanks for your understanding and happy new year.</p>
