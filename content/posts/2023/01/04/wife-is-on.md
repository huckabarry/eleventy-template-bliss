<p>Wife is on an Every Plate kick again (like Hello Fresh), and currently we’re on week 3. Someone please just put me out of my misery, double tap to the back of the head. Nothing like having to leave work early just to make sure dinner is ready before the kids’ bedtimes. Think my clients will understand if I use an Outlook out of office reply?</p>
