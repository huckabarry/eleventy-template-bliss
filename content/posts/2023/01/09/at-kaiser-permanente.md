<p>At Kaiser Permanente in Beaverton bc my kid cut the webbing on his thumb with a tape measure. Already been here an hour and they say itâ€™s going to be 2 more hours before he can see a doctor and maybe get stitches. I feel like this location, despite being newish, is way too small to serve this area. <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/pdx" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>pdx</span></a> <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/parenthood" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>parenthood</span></a></p>
