<p>Dentistry feels like such a racket at times. My 70-something-year-old ex dentist said I definitely needed a crown on a tooth that had been giving me trouble. Said there was a crack that couldnâ€™t be seen. Seemed extreme to me, so I fired the guy and had it fixed by someone else for a thousand dollars less. Havent had any problems with it since. Glad I got a second opinion.</p>
