<p>My car is seemingly getting close to its last leg and wouldn’t start this morning. My wife and I are considering just creating a ride-hailing budget instead of getting a new second car. Was looking at EVs but to get into anything new would be at least a $500/mo payment not including electricity, insurance, and maintenance. That’s a lot of Lyft rides.</p>
