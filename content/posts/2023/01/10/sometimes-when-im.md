<p>Sometimes when I’m milling about Metro <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/Portland" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>Portland</span></a> I think about how shoddy some of the suburban construction is and imagine how absolutely fucked we’d be if we had some big employers evaporate like Detroit did a few decades ago (ahem, <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/intel" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>intel</span></a> *cough*). At least a lot of the building stock in <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/Detroit" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>Detroit</span></a> was made of super high quality materials. The amount of T-111 sided 1980s boom-time tract housing in the <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/pdx" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>pdx</span></a> area is wild, and it would be absolutely eviscerated.</p>
