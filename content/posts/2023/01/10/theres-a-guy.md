<p>There’s a guy in CA with the same name as me who keeps trying to use my Gmail account as an alias for another email address. I also keep getting receipts from his business expenses, and I’ve even received some legal documents from his attorney a couple times. I’ve emailed the guy several times now and he just doesn’t respond. Boomers!</p>
