<p>I still have and occasionally use a couple of <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/MiniDisc" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>MiniDisc</span></a> recorders, strangely enough. </p><p>Mostly nostalgia, but they’re great for teaching my kid about physical media and forcing myself to listen to entire albums. </p><p>There is a small but passionate community of users, too. Someone even developed a browser app to get music onto NetMD recorders without the need for Sony software. It’s awesome.</p>
