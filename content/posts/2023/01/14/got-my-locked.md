<p>Got my locked and dead car opened up and the battery on a charger. Battery had died last weekend bc my 4 year old turned on a dome light and I hadn’t needed the car so I just left it. </p><p>Key slot was jammed up, too, because I never use it. But lots of silicon lubricant later, I’m in. </p><p>Felt like a thief in my hoodie in the pouring rain trying to break into my own car! Heh</p>
