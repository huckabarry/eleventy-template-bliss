<p>“I just feel like there must had been a time when the world had more...you know? Like mystery or something and now you come somewhere like this and it&#39;s beautiful and you take a picture and then you realize that everybody is taking that exact same picture from that exact same spot, you just made some redundant content for stupid Instagram and you can&#39;t even get lost anymore cause you can find yourself on Google Maps.”  2/2 <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/thewhitelotus" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>thewhitelotus</span></a></p>
