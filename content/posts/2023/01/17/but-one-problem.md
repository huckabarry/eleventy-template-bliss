<p>“But one problem with pinning everything on Elon is that it leaves open the possibility that maybe Twitter would be fine if the company was led by a different CEO who continued the Twitter API status quo. I don’t think so. Twitter wasn’t going to last forever because massive ad-based silos will always be at odds with the open web. Twitter’s recent implosion greatly accelerated what would need to happen regardless.” <a href="https://www.manton.org/2023/01/17/more-brief-thoughts.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">manton.org/2023/01/17/more-bri</span><span class="invisible">ef-thoughts.html</span></a></p>
