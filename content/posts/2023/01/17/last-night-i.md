<p>Last night I found this photo from 1986 in my grandmother’s belongings. It’s of me and my brother. I’d never seen it before. </p><p>Everyone always says how much my son looks like my wife, so I was blown away by how much I look like him here. I was just a little bit older than he is now. </p><p>My dad left us when I was two. I feel so bad for him that he missed out on what it’s like to be a father to such an exceptional little human.</p><p><img src="https://files.mastodon.social/media_attachments/files/109/706/271/594/371/596/original/63a687dfd882355d.jpeg">
