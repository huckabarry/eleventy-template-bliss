<p>In 5th grade, me and my classmates in Midland, Michigan were each assigned a state and were tasked with writing letters to their tourism departments requesting information. I got California and I remember clearly that they just sent me a huge envelope of brochures for out-of-the-way places. Still thinking about checking you out someday, Pismo Beach. Someday. <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/california" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>california</span></a> <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/ca" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>ca</span></a></p>
