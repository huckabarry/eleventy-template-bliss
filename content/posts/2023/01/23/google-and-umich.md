<p>Google and <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/umich" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>umich</span></a> are taking away my unlimited cloud storage for alumni. This, after 10 years of me uploading all of my photos and videos from every device Iâ€™ve owned since. Gonna be fun offloading several hundred gigs and figuring out another solution. Most likely their plan all along. <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/Plex" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>Plex</span></a> mobile photos app, where are you when I need you?</p>
