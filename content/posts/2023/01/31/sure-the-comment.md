<p>Sure, the comment sections are bad. But what gets me is that each of those comments represent a real human who is generally afraid to say those things out loud, but whom nevertheless still walk this earth with that junk seething inside of them. Thatâ€™s the type of shit that keeps me up at night.</p>
