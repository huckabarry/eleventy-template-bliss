<p>It’s strange that I’m in my early 40s and I still have to pretty regularly remind people that I’m in fact a Millennial. It’s like a lot of people older than me have solidified in their minds the image of a Millennial as a snot-nosed 20 something with unrealistic expectations, content on shaking up the workplace. A lot of us are jaded old curmudgeons too now who just want to be left alone. Oh, and get off my lawn.</p>
