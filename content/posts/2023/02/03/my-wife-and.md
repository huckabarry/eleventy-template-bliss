<p>My wife and I have read 3 to 5 books per night to our son since he was about 18 months old. Every single night for 2.5 years. So it’s pretty safe to say we’re kind of experts on children’s books at this point. By FAR the absolute lowest effort books are the Hot Wheels ones. Can’t even believe this garbage was published.</p><p><img src="https://files.mastodon.social/media_attachments/files/109/804/675/812/897/357/original/22ac2d9b9e664350.png">
