<p>Tried out <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/ivory" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>ivory</span></a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/mammoth" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>mammoth</span></a> the last couple months but I’m loving the <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/icecubes" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>icecubes</span></a> iOS client the most. </p><p>One thing that’s huge for me is that the entire person’s @ is always visible, allowing you to see from where a post originated. Also just a clean and thoughtful implementation with plenty of customization without being overwhelming. I especially like the drop down menu at top to change feeds, and ability to follow other instances.</p>
