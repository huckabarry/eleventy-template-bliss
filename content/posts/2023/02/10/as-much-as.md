<p>As much as I like Apple, I enjoy Google Newsâ€™ content suggestions better than Apple News. </p><p>Still, Google Amp web pages are annoying and I really dislike all the ads everywhere. My workaround. </p><p>I ended up deleting the Google News app altogether in favor of just bookmarking it in Safari. Then I downloaded a Safari extension to redirect all Amp pages to their real pages. I then setup Reader Mode in Safari to automatically open when visiting dozens of news sources. Finally a decent experience!</p>
