<p>Although not quite on the same level as Salt &amp; Straw’s Berry Slab Pie ice cream flavor, I just dug into some Tillamook Marionberry Pie ice cream and it’s pretty dang good. And you don’t even have to wait 12 months or in a line around the block just to try some. <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/pdx" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>pdx</span></a></p>
