<p>People sometimes seem like dogs in that we will gang up on a weak member of the pack. Even my normally chill Goldendoodle will join in on the hazing of a weak dog at the park if left alone. </p><p>Iâ€™ve noticed humans are equally dark, often rooting for people with the quickest wit over the biggest heart, snark contrarianism over thoughtfulness. It is very hard to see the good in humanity sometimes.</p>
