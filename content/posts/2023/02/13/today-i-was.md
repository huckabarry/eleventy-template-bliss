<p>Today I was thinking back to some conversations I had with my grandmother before she died. </p><p>I was trying to get some info from her to finalize my Italian citizenship paperwork. She was hesitant to help me because she thought Italy was way too liberal. She made me promise that I wouldn’t move there before she gave me what I needed.</p><p>Sadly her medical care nearly bankrupted her at the end, something she wouldn’t have had to worry about had she lived in Italy. Stockholm syndrome comes to mind.</p>
