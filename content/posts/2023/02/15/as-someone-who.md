<p>As someone who went into 6 figures of student debt to get a graduate degree just to allow me to get an entry level job in my field, I believe we need to fix this system. </p><p>Not only do I believe we need widespread student debt forgiveness, we need to stop kidding ourselves about the true value of higher ed. </p><p>Most jobs besides those with the highest standards for licensure are completely trainable. Higher ed has turned into gatekeeping a middle class life, which we all should have access to.</p>
