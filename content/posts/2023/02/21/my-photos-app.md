My photos app reminded me I saw Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks at the Loving Touch in Ferndale 9 years ago today. Man I miss that place! I saw so many shows there in the early 2010s and you could get so close to the musicians. Iâd like to start seeing shows again, just need to pin down a solid babysitter! #stephenmalkmus #thelovingtouch
