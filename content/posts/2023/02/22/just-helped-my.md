<p>Just helped my neighbor, who is a Spaniard, chain up his car to go retrieve his stranded girlfriend, somewhere on 405 near PSU. Man, that is about as close to a Hail Mary as I’ve ever thrown. Guess I’ll know sometime tomorrow how it all turned out. <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/pdx" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>pdx</span></a></p>
