<p>Thinking back to my first sociology class at University of Michigan in 1999. It was a social stratification lecture and my professor asked every single student on the first day what suburb of Detroit we lived in, and he proceeded to rank our social status based on that. Of course it played into the subject matter, but what a wild experience that stuck with each of us the remainder of the semester. Felt real bad for the girl from Melvindale. <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/umich" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>umich</span></a> <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/socialscience" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>socialscience</span></a> <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/sociology" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>sociology</span></a></p>
