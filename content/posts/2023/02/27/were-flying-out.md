<p>Weâ€™re flying out of PDX on Wednesday to meet my Michigander parents for a week long vacation in San Diego. </p><p>Figures that the week we chose and planned for months ago ends up being the same week Southern California gets record snow and colder weather. Detroit will actually be warmer than SD on Wednesday.</p>
