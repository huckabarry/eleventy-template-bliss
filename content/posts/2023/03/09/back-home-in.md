<p>Back home in Portland after a week in San Diego. We rented an amazing mid-century modern ranch in Point Loma (Zestimate $1.9M). Now we’re back in the dreary PNW weather.  </p><p>Took a peek at jobs and housing in SD, just for fun. Cannot comprehend how people can even afford a starter home there when the pay is nowhere close to commensurate. Jobs in my field pay about the same as in PDX but housing is almost 40% more. It’s got to be one of the most expensive cities relative to income in the U.S.</p>
