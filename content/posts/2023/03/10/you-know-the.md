<p>You know the old saying, “better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt”? I have a new perspective on it. </p><p>There was a time when I felt stupid around certain people because I rarely knew what they were talking about. Names, events, cultural references, etc. </p><p>Turns out the people I was with were just domineering and self-centered. If you’re not allowed to speak, you can’t talk about the things you know and enjoy. Solution: find better people.</p>
