<p>Quite a few years ago now I used to listen to the Minimalists podcast, but stopped when they started giving financial advice. The two most egregious tips they gave? 1) Pay off your student debt as quickly as possible, and 2) donâ€™t take out a mortgage for a house unless you can put 50% down and pay it off in 7 years. </p><p>So here I am, several years later, with $107k forgiven in student debt last year, and a sub 3% mortgage, paying almost half for my house as it would cost to rent something similar.</p>
