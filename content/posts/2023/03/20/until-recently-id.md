<p>Until recently, I’d always thought that the question “what is the meaning of life?” was used solely as a rhetorical device to convey the shared existential dilemma of humanity, and the challenges of finding one’s true purpose in life. It hadn’t even occurred to me that it might also be asking why life exists at all.</p>
