<p>Started taking a new ADHD med again, which means I have slept a total of about 2 hours the last 3 nights. Back in the day, I could take a nap on Dex. Not anymore. <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/Today" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>Today</span></a> was pretty rough being extremely focused but absolutely exhausted. Wife had a meeting after work and happy hour with coworkers so getting the kids fed and keeping them entertaining was more difficult than normal.  Hoping things level out.</p>
