<p>Two shower thoughts tonight:</p><p>1) I have an absolutely awful memory for celebrity names and I don’t watch sports. Don’t invite me to trivia. </p><p>2) Isn’t the Buddhist belief in rebirth just a desire, given that we’re all just talking viruses with consciousness, biding our time until we’re space dust again, man?</p>
