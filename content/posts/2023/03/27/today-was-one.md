Today was one of those days where all of my next steps on a project are awaiting other people to finish theirs. Happens too often. So I threw on my headphones, caught up on some Italian language podcasts, and mindlessly did some spreadsheet work. I’m unfulfilled and want a new career but don’t want to put in the effort it would take to make a change at this point in my life.
