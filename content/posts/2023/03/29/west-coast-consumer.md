<p>West coast consumer price index is up 15% since January 2021, yet my place of work decided to reduce their cost of living adjustments, so we’re doing the same jobs for about 7% less pay than we were two years ago. They’re eliminating some positions that had remained unfilled due to budgetary reasons, so some folks will continue doing multiple jobs for less pay.</p>
