<p>I’m having a difficult time learning Italian possessive adjectives (my, hers, his, theirs, etc.). </p><p>I think the hardest part for me is that they’re dependent upon the nouns that come later, so there are so many variations and my mind isn’t fast enough to work them out ahead of time. </p><p>Not only do the possessives vary depending on the gender of the noun, they also depend on what letter the noun ends with and whether that noun is plural or not. Mind bending.</p><p><a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/italiano" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>italiano</span></a> <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/language" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>language</span></a></p>
