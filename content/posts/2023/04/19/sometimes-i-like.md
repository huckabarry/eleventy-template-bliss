<p>Sometimes I like to watch old interviews with musicians. </p><p>Often I’m surprised by how different my perception of them is compared to the reality. I’m sure to a large degree that’s an intentional curation, making gods out of men.</p><p>I was just 13 when Kurt Cobain died in 1994, so at 27 years old he just looked like a grown ass man to me. </p><p>Watching his interviews now, he looked so young and even childish. Not a bad thing, just a reflection on how our perceptions can change as we age.</p>
