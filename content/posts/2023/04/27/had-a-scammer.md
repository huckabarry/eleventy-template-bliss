Had a scammer try to buy $600 in nonsense from a pharmacy 2,000 miles away this morning. 

Glad I got the email from Instacart saying my address on file had changed, and that I woke up early today. I was able to chat with the shopper and have the account shut down before anything was delivered or charged.

I use complex passwords and don’t click on strange links, so not sure how this happened. Good reminder to shut down old accounts. Passkeys can’t get here soon enough.
