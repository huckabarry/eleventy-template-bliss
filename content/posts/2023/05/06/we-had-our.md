We had our friend Alyssa watch our kids for a few hours today so we could have some time to ourselves, something that is so often in short supply. 

Went for a nice bike ride in the rain on the Banks-Vernonia Oregon State Trail and followed it up with a beer and some Texas style BBQ brisket at Hop Cycle.
