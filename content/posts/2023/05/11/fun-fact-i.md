Fun fact: I applied for and received a grant a few years back for a 3,200 gallon cistern that collects rainwater from my roof all winter long. Thereâ€™s a pump inside that I connected to a drip irrigation system and I use it to water my garden all summer long since our summers in the PNW are very dry.
