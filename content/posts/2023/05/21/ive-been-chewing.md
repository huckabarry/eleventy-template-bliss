<p>I’ve been chewing a bit on the saying: “[don’t take] the path of least resistance.” </p><p>Knowing full well that much of life is work and few things are worth a damn without putting in at least some sort of energy toward them, I still have my doubts about focusing on something too much. </p><p>I find myself reassessing the dreams and goals that I’ve worked on that have taken more energy than given back. I think sometimes the universe is guiding us, and the work is a major guidepost.</p>
