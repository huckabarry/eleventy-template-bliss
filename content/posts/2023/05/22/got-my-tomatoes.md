<p>Got my tomatoes planted outside yesterday. Really wish I had more space because I only have room for 6 plants or so and I have a lot of good starts left over. I might put a couple in some 5 gallon buckets. </p><p>I did get the zucchini and acorn squash out of the raised beds and into mounds this year, which gave me room to experiment with things I donâ€™t typically grow. </p><p>Dunno why, but growing stuff is fun.</p>
