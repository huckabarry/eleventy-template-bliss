<p>A friend started talking about the old Kmart on State Street in Saginaw. Got me thinking about all kinds of memories, like getting new clothes and those nasty submarine sandwiches at that Kmart with my mom as a kid, being dragged into Fashion Bug or Payless, getting the slightly off-color Cub Scout uniforms from Sears, and of course, stopping into the long-closed Dawn Donuts.</p>
