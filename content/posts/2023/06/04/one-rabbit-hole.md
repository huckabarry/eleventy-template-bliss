<p>One rabbit hole I find myself in sometimes is looking up bands who disbanded or who had one or two hits and then faded away. Often you can still find a few of the former members on YouTube.</p><p>Neil Young is often quoted with the lyric, “It’s better to burn out than to fade away.” I choose neither. </p><p>In a former life, I thought I wanted to be a big-time musician, but I’m glad I wasn’t. I’d much rather have the humble life I’ve lived in relative quiet and near total anonymity.</p>
