Despite getting a lot of rain 8 months out of the year, the PNW gets virtually zero precip during the 4 hottest months. 

With worsening droughts, Iâ€™ve become a big water conservationist. 5 years ago, I had a 3,100 gallon rain cistern installed. I can burn through this in 2 mos. on just 3 raised beds.
