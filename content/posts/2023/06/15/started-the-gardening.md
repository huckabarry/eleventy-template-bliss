Started the gardening year late, but I think weâ€™re gonna be okay. My tomato plants have grown quite a bit since transplanting. Just pruned the bottoms and put the side supports up. 

<img src="uploads/2023/ba8d073a61.jpg" width="600" height="449" alt="Photographed are two raised beds made of 2 by 12 inch weathered wood filled with early season vegetable plants, with one of the 4X8 foot beds comprised almost entirely of medium size tomato plants about one and a half feet high, spaced apart about 24 inches. Hog wire fence is placed inside each side of the bed for supports as the tomatoes grow. A bush of about 6 feet high sits behind the box with pink flowers. ">
