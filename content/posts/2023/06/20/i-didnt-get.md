I didn’t get to drywalling the kitchen ceiling yesterday. As I was squaring up some existing drywall in preparation for placing the patch, I noticed another small leak in the drain pipe below the master bath. My wife was just finishing up giving the kids a bath, and a small amount of water was coming out from the top of the P-trap. This appeared to be an error the plumber made when they built my house. Small annoyance, but I’m glad it showed itself before I closed things up. Homeownership, man.
