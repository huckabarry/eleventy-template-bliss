My property abuts two roads that don’t connect. My yard is often the shortest path between two
points, for kids coming and going to school, or adults trying to catch a train at the MAX station. 

My camera catches people cutting through my garden all day. Recently, some kids trampled my acorn squash. 

Instead of putting up a fence, I decided to clear away some landscaping for a path around my garden. It doesn’t take a degree in urban planning to know these two roads should’ve connected.
