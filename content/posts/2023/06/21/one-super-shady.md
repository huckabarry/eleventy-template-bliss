One super shady practice by Oregon realtors is the almost universal inclusion of unfinished basement space in the overall square footage in home listings. I often see houses listed at double their actual livable square footage. Buyers should do their due diligence and get the actual livable area from the county tax assessor. Often this info is public and sometimes itâ€™s online. In the Portland area, you can look up any property at [Portland Maps](https://www.portlandmaps.com).
