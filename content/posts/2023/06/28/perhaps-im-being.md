Perhaps I’m being a little too sensitive, but yesterday a superior of mine told me to tuck in my shirt, and it offended me.

I was dressed in navy chinos and a nice button down shirt, but I’d been at my desk for almost 8 hours and wanted to be comfortable. I was preparing for a televised night meeting where I’d present in front of a government body. 

I’ve led these hearings 8-10 times per year for going on six years now. I have never, not once, not tucked in my shirt for a public hearing.
