Did a good bit of cleaning up around the front garden beds this morning and fixed a sprinkler that my wife ran over with the lawnmower. 

My son always likes being by my side when I’m working on stuff, especially when it involves water. It’s sunny and pretty hot out, so we decided to get a little wet testing the sprinklers :)
