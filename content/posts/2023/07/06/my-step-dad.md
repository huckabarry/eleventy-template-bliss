My step dad turns 60 this weekend, which is why I’m in Michigan from Oregon. My brother just got partial custody of his kid after a weird stretched out, ass backwards Michigan court battle thing. So his kid (5) and my kid (4), first cousins, just met for the first time (in person). We’re all “camping” this weekend at my parents’ RV site. How freaking fun this is already to watch them together!
