Ironically, things really went downhill with my health since quitting smoking nearly 7 years ago, and then becoming a parent shortly after. 

I’ve been walking a couple miles with my dog each morning this week, trying to change trajectories with my health, both mental and physical.

I don’t know if it will truly do any good, but doing nothing sure hasn't. I figure I’ve got to start somewhere.
