It’s sort of hard to follow a Micro.blog account if you don’t have a link to your actual m.b page on your blog. 

I’ve noticed this a lot more frequently lately with people using the Tiny theme. 

If I come across a M.b through a Mastodon profile, for instance, there often is no link to follow you.
