One of the craziest things I never expected to experience as an adult is being part of a two-earner household, both with graduate degrees, in the top 15% of earners, making almost double the median income, and still feeling pinched by finances. 

Donâ€™t get me wrong, we have a lot to be thankful for. Still, despite having the luxury of saving for retirement and having an emergency fund, we essentially live paycheck to paycheck, and feel trapped in our house due to home values and interest rates.
