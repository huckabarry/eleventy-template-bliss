My sleep game has improved so much over the last 6 months. 

After my younger brother died in 2021, I couldnâ€™t shut off the anxiety at night, so I often distracted myself with my phone. I got maybe 3-4 hours per night for like a year. 

In addition to working through my grief, a combo of putting the phone down at a reasonable time, using earplugs, and dialing in the CPAP have been key for me. 

I now get a solid 7 hours and wake up without an alarm. My mental health has improved a lot as a result.
