Dealing with hair loss is pretty emotionally uncomfortable in itself, but add scalp psoriasis to the mix and things can get socially awkward pretty fast, too. 

I hear “just shave it off!” all the time. Thing is, shaving my head often makes my psoriasis much worse. 

Not sure why people are always offering their unsolicited advice or why they think it’s ever appropriate to comment on other peoples’ bodies.
