I’ve dealt with anxiety all my life. Despite this, I have a job that requires me to present to government boards and the public very regularly. 

So imagine my surprise when my Board recently thanked me during a busy session for the great job I do on my presentations. Following that, someone remarked that I was “measured and confident” when speaking.

It’s strange how so often worry can consume us unnecessarily, how our perceptions of ourselves can crowd out reality and detract from the good in us.
