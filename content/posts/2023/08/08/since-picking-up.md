Since picking up that cheap Canadian folk guitar last week, I have been seriously considering selling my Martin 000-28. It’s a beautiful guitar, but I’m really wondering now if a 00-12 fret might be more my speed. Punchier, more balanced tone. Looking at other Martins, Santa Cruz, and Waterloo. Drop me a line if you have any experience with these smaller body guitars or have suggestions.
