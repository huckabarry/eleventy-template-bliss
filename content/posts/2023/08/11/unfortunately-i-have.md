Unfortunately, I have noticed my attention span being whittled away at slowly over the last 10 years. I have ADHD, but no supprise that it’s gotten worse since about the time I picked up my first smartphone. 

I consume the news, but a lot of the time I can’t even be bothered to read a full newsletter in my inbox, let alone read an entire book. I’m committing to a mid-year resolution to slow down and consume less randomness in hopes of redirecting my attention toward more meaningful things.
