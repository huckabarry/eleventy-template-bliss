Last year we lost our neighborhood Indian restaurant, our favorite. We were pretty upset when it closed, and quite honestly, we still are. 

But since then, we’ve learned of all sorts of new things moving in nearby. In the place of the Indian restaurant, we’re now getting a brewery, one that we can walk to from our house. 

Also, a new Himalayan dumpling place opened and it’s excellent!
