I was having a text conversation with my brother this evening. He hadn’t heard of ChatGPT yet, so I showed him an example and he told me that this reminded him of that song by Tool about California being flushed away into the Pacific Ocean.

I said, “Arizona Bay?”

“Yeah,” he said. 

I asked ChatGPT again: “Tell me about the song ‘Arizona Bay’ by Tool.” 

This was its response:

>"Arizona Bay" is not a song by Tool. However, it is a term coined by the band's lead singer, Maynard James Keenan, and it is the title of a comedy album by comedian Bill Hicks. 

>Bill Hicks was a renowned American stand-up comedian known for his thought-provoking and often controversial material. He frequently discussed topics such as politics, society, and religion in his performances. "Arizona Bay" was recorded in 1996 and released posthumously in 1997, following Hicks' death.

>The term "Arizona Bay" itself refers to a hypothetical scenario where the state of Arizona, along with parts of Southern California, would be submerged underwater due to a massive earthquake, resulting in the creation of a new coastline. Hicks used this concept as a metaphor for his vision of a better society, one that would emerge after the collapse of the current societal and political systems.

>Maynard James Keenan, being a fan of Bill Hicks, drew inspiration from his work and incorporated some of Hicks' ideas into Tool's music. Although "Arizona Bay" is not a song by Tool, the band has paid tribute to Bill Hicks in their performances and even sampled some of his comedy bits in their songs.

>So while "Arizona Bay" may not be a Tool song, it holds significance in the band's history and the influence of Bill Hicks on their music and worldview.
