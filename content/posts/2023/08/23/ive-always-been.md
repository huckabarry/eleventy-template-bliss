I’ve always been left of center politically, but there’s a quote often credited to Reagan that I’ve kept above my computer screen for years:

“If you’re explaining, you’re losing.”

It’s a loaded saying, but to me it boils down to the idea that people can sometimes be more emotional than logical, so you should try to keep your arguments as simple as possible. I think this has served me well.
