We’re getting a little taste of fall this morning in the Portland area, with the overcast skies and mist. I’ve missed it!  

When I first moved here, several of my friends and family asked me how I could stand so much rain in the winter. Well, to be honest, I’ve always had more of a problem with the summers than the winters.

Pretty much nonstop sunshine, close to zero rain, dry as a tinder box, and way hotter than I generally like it to be. I love the rainy season.
