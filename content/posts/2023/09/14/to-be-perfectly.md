To be perfectly honest, I thought Sidecar for iPad was sort of gimmicky when it was first announced. But I actually use it all the time when Iâ€™m out and about. I often write long (too long!) reports where I need to reference other materials and Sidecar is perfect for this sort of thing. I love it.
